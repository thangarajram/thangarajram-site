          <strong>Abstract:</strong> Design workshops are a popular approach to include older adults in the technology design process. However, formative design sessions with older adults have had unexpected outcomes such as the non-use of traditional design materials like craft-based prototyping supplies or disengagement from design activities. Analyzing the engagement of 32 older adults across two design workshops, this paper sheds insights on some of these outcomes. Contributing to a growing body of HCI research on understanding older adults’ participation in design, we provide an understanding of how design materials can shape older adults’ engagement in formative design activities. Our discussion furthers research on understanding who older adults design for and why, argues for a different understanding of creative expression, and offers considerations for choosing design materials.

          <strong>Abstract:</strong> What happens to a person’s data after they pass away? Designing for digital legacy requires input from individuals across all life stages, as motivations to plan vary with age. Yet, the specific perspectives that older adults have on end-of-life data management have not been investigated in depth. Through interviews with 16 older adults, we examine their preferences and motivations for managing everyday digital data (e.g., text messages, social media, photos) after death. Our findings surface several implications for end-of-life data planning, including creating awareness about digital legacy and associated risks. We also unpack and discuss how older adults’ life stage and familiarity with end-of-life planning uniquely positions them to identify barriers and opportunities in managing digital legacy, such as how post-mortem data can encode societal norms of a period or be donated for the greater good.

          <strong>Abstract:</strong> Emoji skin tone modifiers, designed to reflect human skin tone diversity, can signal racial and ethnic identities, shaping user preferences. However, much of this knowledge is derived from Western cultural contexts. Given that cultural norms shape user preferences and identity associations with emoji skin tones, understanding perspectives from users globally is essential. To this end, we conducted a survey to examine skin tone modifier preferences among Indian-origin users. Our findings suggest that women, regardless of self-perceived skin tone, are more likely to use emoji skin tones matching their own and value the range of options more than men. Our discussion raises caution about designing for neutrality in computing and offers directions for future research. </p>
