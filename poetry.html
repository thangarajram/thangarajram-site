        Poetry has long been a space for me to reflect, connect, and play with expression—from sibling bonds to chicken fried rice. I recently published a debut poetry collection:
        <a href="https://ebooks.bookleafpub.com/product-page/a-dot-in-the-dark" class="underline text-indigo-600 font-medium">A Dot in the Dark</a>.

        Below are a few selected pieces that span memory, food, relationships, and everyday beauty.

          <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm mt-2 text-gray-800">Posing a permanent enigma, you stand still ever
With a smile and a sneer and a million shades of marvel
Crafted with panache, a portrait by the master
Of course, it’s you, Madam Lisa!

Countless eyes gazing you away
Painting their hearts with your majestic life
On the canvas of a remarkably queer bargain
‘You gave life or it, you?’

Here I lay, on a bed of nails and roses
Reflecting over, reigning over the trauma
When I paid a penny, for my own thought
A colourless colourful rendition of the same

An inharmonious piece of work, seemingly, now would it?
Perhaps no, we would say
A silhouette portrait of you, the polished trait of myself
Truth be told, my life indeed. A harsh depiction of reality.

A pitch of dark wandering all over, seeking its companions, all in vain
Broke into a line of thought, I did
‘Face the brightness, hence the shade’
Scaling the icy mountains, the winding paths and the distant bridge
I stand, against the Sun, with a beautiful view of them thence

A portrait it paints itself, a silhouette of myself
Whilst the majesty of hers stands stall, with both the shades
I wouldn’t run myself into a pool of worries
For, Ma’am Lisa, just another way, it is
To portray, the parallel elegance, a masterpiece in itself

The sterling silhouette portrait</pre>

          <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm mt-2 text-gray-800">Curvy and swirvy
Marbled in white
In its thunderous might
Slowly and slowly

The Bridge to Everywhereland
It climbs, and it climbs
A solemn hand 
Unwanting to succumb

Palatial, infinite spatial
Breaks and cracks adorned
As jewels, traipsing
Along the coast, no railing

A thousand souls trudged the path
A million souls engulfed in wrath
Upon this long and winding journey 
They who commandeer, conquer thus

The Everywhereland
Everyone's place
Dreams are met
Unless unkempt

The Bridge to Everywhereland
A solemn hand
To everyone's place
A future in grace</pre>

          <summary class="cursor-pointer font-semibold text-indigo-700">My little sister (2023)</summary>
          <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm mt-2 text-gray-800">You know that I've always hated you
When you were in mum's tummy
When you were born like a bunny
Tiny little creature, so funny

You know that I've always annoyed you
When you were deep in your own thoughts
When you played with your likes, reels, shorts
Don't you still connect the dots? 

But did you know
That I've always loved you? 
That hate's my foolish way of staying true?

My little sister, you are so far away 
I have our memories for company
Distances become so tiny 
Seemingly

Though I can't see your annoyed face
In a naughtily childish haze
I'll always hate you
Like how you hate me too</pre>

          <summary class="cursor-pointer font-semibold text-indigo-700">Chicken fried rice (2024)</summary>
          <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm mt-2 text-gray-800">Let's start with my eyes
I see the white of the rice and the brown of the chicken
The green of the peas and the yellow of the yolk
It's love at first sight 
My eyes extend an arm
As if to kiss with vision

Now comes the nose
The pepper of it all
And the soy
Oh, boy! 

"Shall I sniff you for eternity?"

My tastebuds are screaming,
"GET HER TO ME AT ONCE, SILLY HANDS"
The food and my tongue
Are engaged in a loud (consensual) sex
That my mouth has put up a 'DND' sign 

Oh, chicken fried rice,
I can never get enough of you.</pre>
