      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">About</h2>
      <p>I am a PhD student in Information Systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. Alisha Pradhan. 
My research lies in Human-Computer Interaction, with a focus on <strong>post-mortem data management</strong> and <strong>digital identity expression</strong>. 
My current work explores what happens to our personal data after we die. I primarily use qualitative methods such as interviews and co-design workshops with adults aged 65 and above.<br><br>
In addition to end-of-life data planning, I am also interested in how South Asian users express digital identity through non-verbal communication media, including emoji skin tone modifiers and reaction GIFs.<br><br>
Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Master‚Äôs in User Experience Design from Birmingham City University (UK) and worked as a management consultant with Ernst & Young LLP (India), focusing on supply chain optimization in healthcare and the oil & gas sectors. 
I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (India).<br><br>
Outside of academia, I enjoy writing and performing poetry (I recently published a collection), organizing technology workshops for seniors and returning citizens, 
and playing musical instruments such as the ukulele, drums, and keyboard. I‚Äôve also recently started exploring acrylic painting‚Äîmostly still-life subjects.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI ‚Äô25), 2025</p>

          <strong>Abstract:</strong> Design workshops are a popular approach to include older adults in the technology design process. However, formative design sessions with older adults have had unexpected outcomes such as the non-use of traditional design materials like craft-based prototyping supplies or disengagement from design activities. Analyzing the engagement of 32 older adults across two design workshops, this paper sheds insights on some of these outcomes. Contributing to a growing body of HCI research on understanding older adults‚Äô participation in design, we provide an understanding of how design materials can shape older adults‚Äô engagement in formative design activities. Our discussion furthers research on understanding who older adults design for and why, argues for a different understanding of creative expression, and offers considerations for choosing design materials.

          <strong>Abstract:</strong> What happens to a person‚Äôs data after they pass away? Designing for digital legacy requires input from individuals across all life stages, as motivations to plan vary with age. Yet, the specific perspectives that older adults have on end-of-life data management have not been investigated in depth. Through interviews with 16 older adults, we examine their preferences and motivations for managing everyday digital data (e.g., text messages, social media, photos) after death. Our findings surface several implications for end-of-life data planning, including creating awareness about digital legacy and associated risks. We also unpack and discuss how older adults‚Äô life stage and familiarity with end-of-life planning uniquely positions them to identify barriers and opportunities in managing digital legacy, such as how post-mortem data can encode societal norms of a period or be donated for the greater good.

          <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm mt-2 text-gray-800">Posing a permanent enigma, you stand still ever
With a smile and a sneer and a million shades of marvel
Crafted with panache, a portrait by the master
Of course, it‚Äôs you, Madam Lisa!
Countless eyes gazing you away
Painting their hearts with your majestic life
On the canvas of a remarkably queer bargain
‚ÄòYou gave life or it, you?‚Äô
Here I lay, on a bed of nails and roses
Reflecting over, reigning over the trauma
When I paid a penny, for my own thought
A colourless colourful rendition of the same
An inharmonious piece of work, seemingly, now would it?
Perhaps no, we would say
A silhouette portrait of you, the polished trait of myself
Truth be told, my life indeed. A harsh depiction of reality.
A pitch of dark wandering all over, seeking it‚Äôs companions, all in vain
Broke into a line of thought, I did
‚ÄòFace the brightness, hence the shade‚Äô
Scaling the icy mountains, the winding paths and the distant bridge
I stand, against the Sun, with a beautiful view of them thence
A portrait it paints itself, a silhouette of myself
Whilst the majesty of hers stands stall, with both the shades
I wouldn‚Äôt run myself into a pool of worries
For, Ma‚Äôam Lisa, just another way, it is
To portray, the parallel elegance, a masterpiece in itself
The sterling silhouette portrait</pre>

Marbled in white
In its thunderous might
Slowly and slowly

The Bridge to Everywhereland
It climbs, and it climbs
A solemn hand 
Unwanting to succumb

Palatial, infinite spatial
Breaks and cracks adorned
As jewels, traipsing
Along the coast, no railing

A thousand souls trudged the path
A million souls engulfed in wrath
Upon this long and winding journey 
They who commandeer, conquer thus

The Everywhereland
Everyone's place
Dreams are met
Unless unkempt

The Bridge to Everywhereland
A solemn hand
To everyone's place
A future in grace</pre>

When you were in mum's tummy
When you were born like a bunny
Tiny little creature, so funny

You know that I've always annoyed you
When you were deep in your own thoughts
When you played with your likes, reels, shorts
Don't you still connect the dots? 

But did you know
That I've always loved you? 
That hate's my foolish way of staying true?

My little sister, you are so far away 
I have our memories for company
Distances become so tiny 
Seemingly

Though I can't see your annoyed face
In a naughtily childish haze
I'll always hate you
Like how you hate me too</pre>

I see the white of the rice and the brown of the chicken
The green of the peas and the yellow of the yolk
It's love at first sight 
My eyes extend an arm
As if to kiss with vision

Now comes the nose
The pepper of it all
And the soy
Oh, boy! 

"Shall I sniff you for eternity?"

My tastebuds are screaming,
"GET HER TO ME AT ONCE, SILLY HANDS"
The food and my tongue
Are engaged in a loud (consensual) sex
That my mouth has put up a 'DND' sign 

Oh, chicken fried rice,
I can never get enough of you.</pre>
