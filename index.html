    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">About</h2>
        <p>I am a PhD student in Information Systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. Alisha Pradhan. 
My research lies in Human-Computer Interaction, with a focus on <strong>post-mortem data management</strong> and <strong>digital identity expression</strong>. 
My current work explores what happens to our personal data after we die. I primarily use qualitative methods such as interviews and co-design workshops with adults aged 65 and above.<br><br>
In addition to end-of-life data planning, I am also interested in how South Asian users express digital identity through non-verbal communication media, including emoji skin tone modifiers and reaction GIFs.<br><br>
Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Masterâ€™s in User Experience Design from Birmingham City University (UK) and worked as a management consultant with Ernst & Young LLP (India), focusing on supply chain optimization in healthcare and the oil & gas sectors. 
I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (India).<br><br>
Outside of academia, I enjoy writing and performing poetry (I recently published a collection), organizing technology workshops for seniors and returning citizens, 
and playing musical instruments such as the ukulele, drums, and keyboard. Iâ€™ve also recently started exploring acrylic paintingâ€”mostly still-life subjects.</p>
