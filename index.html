      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        I am a PhD student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. Alisha Pradhan.
        I conduct Human-Computer Interaction research, with a focus on aging. More specifically, I am interested in what happens to our personal data after we die — <strong>post-mortem data management</strong>.
        My work predominantly involves conducting interviews and design workshops with adults aged 65 and above.
        Additionally, I am also interested in <strong>digital identity</strong> expression among South Asian users through non-verbal communication media such as emoji skin tone modifiers and GIFs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        Prior to moving to the U.S. for my PhD, I completed my Master’s in User Experience Design at Birmingham City University (UK).
        I also worked as a management consultant (healthcare and oil & gas supply chain optimization) at Ernst and Young LLP in India for over four years.
        Before joining EY, I completed my Bachelor’s in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (India).
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm">
        In my free time, I like to volunteer/organize workshops for helping seniors and returning citizens with technology, write poetry (recently published my poetry collection), perform poetry at open mics,
        and play a few musical instruments (ukulele, drums, and keyboard). Recently, I started exploring acrylic painting, mainly still life subjects.
